                        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                        <p>I've spent most of my career behind the scenes—helping innovators, policymakers, and founders connect the dots and build meaningful things. From advising tech-focused public policy, to supporting university research partnerships, to now working with global companies looking to grow in Canada through my role at Toronto Global, my work has always centered on enabling others to succeed.</p>
                        
                        <p>I studied at the University of Toronto and OCAD University, and I've always been drawn to the spaces where creativity, strategy, and community meet. While I don't come from a traditional founder path, I care deeply about the people who build—and about doing the quiet work that helps make that possible.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>📍 Current location: Toronto</strong></p>

                <h2>International Strategy and Global Relationships</h2>
                
                <p>My work centers on how companies scale across borders—particularly how international businesses successfully expand into and leverage the Canadian market. This isn't just about market entry mechanics; it's about the strategic decisions that determine whether expansion creates real value.</p>
                
                <p>Through my role at Toronto Global, I've worked with international companies—especially from the U.S.—looking to establish or expand their presence in Canada. This involves everything from market entry strategy and site selection to navigating regulatory requirements and building local partnerships. I've helped companies across sectors like tech, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing understand the Canadian market, access talent, and leverage incentives.</p>
                
                <p>What I find most interesting is the value creation opportunity in these transitions. When a company expands internationally, they're making strategic bets on talent markets, regulatory environments, supply chain proximity, and ecosystem access. Getting these decisions right can unlock significant growth.</p>
                
                <p>My work sits at the intersection of strategy, policy, and execution. I've developed strong intuition for the factors that determine success—from cultural nuances in hiring to the realities of cross-border partnership dynamics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Notable expansions I've supported:</strong> Cerebras, Groq, Databricks, Harvey AI, Netflix, and more.</p>

                    <p>I am actively building bridges across Canada's defence, technology, and investment ecosystem. My work brings together founders, investors, veterans, and policy leaders to explore how Canadian talent, capital, and industrial capacity can be mobilized for national resilience.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through dinners, curated conversations, and partnerships, I am shaping a civic and industrial mission that connects frontier technologies—AI, autonomy, advanced manufacturing—with real-world defence and security needs. At its heart, this project is about convening the right people and pushing forward ideas that strengthen both Canada's innovation economy and its national security.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes the best business conversations happen over breakfast. Instead of formal networking events with business cards and elevator pitches, we gather over good food and real conversation. It's where entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders can connect without the usual corporate pretense—just genuine discussion about challenges, opportunities, and what we're actually working on.</p>
                    
                    <p>But let's be honest—I love pancakes, and this is basically my professional excuse to eat them guilt-free.</p>

                                <p>Let's get something out of the way: trade wars are no longer abstract. They're not chapter headings in economics textbooks or theoretical debates in Ottawa or D.C. They're real, they're messy, and they're directly impacting how we build companies, pick markets, and hedge global risk. And right now, Canada—yes, quiet, friendly, under-the-radar Canada—is in the crosshairs of a full-blown trade rupture with the United States.</p>
                                
                                <p>In a scenario that feels plucked from satire but is deeply real, a returned President Trump has re-imposed sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods. And Canada? It's not backing down. New Prime Minister Mark Carney has retaliated with tariffs of his own, declared the "friendship is over," and begun a major diversification push. The gloves are off. This isn't NAFTA-era soft power. It's elbows-up economic nationalism.</p>
                                
                                <p>In my work at Toronto Global, supporting international companies expanding into the Toronto Region—particularly U.S. firms across sectors from tech to advanced manufacturing to life sciences—the question is no longer if this will affect us. It's how we respond—and how we keep delivering certainty in uncertain times.</p>

                                <p>When I started working at Canadian Tire—my first real job—I ended up shadowing this guy named Kevin. He wasn't management, but he ran the floor like it was his. Everyone liked him. He always had a joke ready, remembered customers' names, and could charm a frustrated senior into buying the wrong socket wrench and thanking him for it.</p>
                                
                                <p>But here's the thing: Kevin didn't actually know that much about tools. He'd ask me questions about SKUs that I, a 17-year-old barely trained seasonal hire, had to guess my way through. But it didn't matter. Kevin understood people—and in retail, that's 90% of the job.</p>
                                
                                <p>He couldn't explain how he did it. You just had to watch. I did.</p>
                                
                                <p>From Kevin, I learned how to throw compliments like darts—fast, effortless, and mostly accurate. How a little physical presence—like walking beside someone or handing them the item they were looking for—could build micro-trust. How not to challenge people's assumptions, but to lean into their version of the story.</p>
                                
                                <p>He taught me that you didn't need to be good all the time—just memorable in the moments that mattered.</p>
                                
                                <p>The result? Kevin could sell snow shovels in July. He was magnetic. And I wanted to be like him.</p>
                                
                                <p>So I learned the tricks. I learned how to manage a room, how to read moods and mirror them, how to switch gears depending on who I was with. And it worked. It worked in retail, it worked in interviews, it even worked at parties.</p>
                                
                                <p>But when it came to actual friendship—real, lasting, show-up-when-it's-bad friendship—it fell apart.</p>
                                
                                <p>The truth is, you can't game long-haul relationships. You can't endlessly adapt and expect depth to grow. If you're constantly tweaking yourself to be more appealing, you're also telling yourself: who I really am isn't enough.</p>
                                
                                <p>And worse, it's exhausting.</p>
                                
                                <p>There are people in your life—maybe just one or two—who always make you feel like you have to be "on." Where hanging out feels like a low-stakes audition. Where you rehearse your stories a bit more, where your shirt fits a little tighter. And maybe at first, it feels like winning. You're in. You're admired.</p>
                                
                                <p>But you do it 10 times. Then 50. Then 100. And suddenly the whole thing feels like emotional cardio: high effort, low reward.</p>
                                
                                <p>Every time you shift a little to fit someone's frame, you add friction. It's tiny, at first—just a sliver of self-betrayal. But friction adds up. One day, you'll choose ease over effort. You'll stop texting back. You'll ghost the group chat. And you'll tell yourself you're just "too busy." But really, you're just tired of shape-shifting.</p>
                                
                                <p>What I've come to believe is that the real killer of meaningful relationships isn't distance or disagreement—it's the slow, subtle erosion of self over time. Because eventually, we all run out of stamina for pretending.</p>
                                
                                <p>Imagine climbing a mountain with a backpack full of water bottles that aren't yours. That's what curated relationships feel like. You think you're being generous. But you're just making the climb harder, and lonelier.</p>
                                
                                <p>The people worth building with—the ones you actually want around in ten years—won't need the theatrics. They'll want your messy, quiet, smart-ass, distracted, ridiculous self. Not your "customer-facing" version.</p>
                                
                                <p>I used to think Kevin was winning. But eventually I noticed he spent most of his shift in the stockroom, scrolling his phone, cracking jokes with whoever wandered back. That charisma wasn't free—it came with a price. And downtime was how he paid for it.</p>
                                
                                <p>He was recovering. From the weight of the role he had to play.</p>
                                
                                <p>I've played that role too. For a long time. I wanted to be impressive, magnetic, indispensable. I wanted people to think, "Damn, I need that guy around." And maybe they did—for a while. But it wore me down. Because the second you build a relationship on the performance, you're stuck performing just to keep it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Real connection is quiet. It's who still shows up when there's nothing left to impress.</p>
                                
                                <p>So now? I'm aiming for friendships where I don't have to rehearse. Where I don't need a costume. Where being me is—somehow—still enough.</p>
                                
                                <p>Because the people I want around aren't my customers. They're the ones I'll hike with, over and over, for the rest of my life. And for that kind of trip, I need to pack light.</p>

                            <h4>The Quiet Permission of Walkabouts</h4>
                            <p><em>On stepping away to return to yourself</em></p>
                            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleWalkabouts();" id="walkabouts-toggle">Read more</a></p>

                                <p>I've always needed a way to quietly leave. Not escape—just reset. This piece is about the walkabouts I take when I need to be nobody for a little while. Not a productivity hack. Not a routine. Just a quiet return to myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>There's a certain rhythm I've had to relearn—one that isn't scheduled, optimized, or announced. It's not something I talk about often, because it doesn't lend itself to a calendar invite or a thread. But it's shaped everything that matters.</p>
                                
                                <p>I call them walkabouts.</p>
                                
                                <p>Not the kind with hiking boots or backpacks or photo evidence. Not exercise. Not even "getting steps in." My walkabouts are quieter than that. More selfish. They are when I leave—not for long, but long enough. Out the door. Down a street. Sometimes nowhere. Sometimes somewhere very specific. A bench. A railing. A stoop that catches the light.</p>
                                
                                <p>And I just walk.</p>
                                
                                <p>These are not breaks from work. They are breaks from identity. From the version of myself that's required—on calls, in family rooms, in messages, in roles. There are days when I need to stop holding my life up like it's a tray I'm carrying with careful balance, and instead set it down beside me and look at it without needing to perform inside it.</p>
                                
                                <p>That's what a walkabout gives me: a chance to step outside the story I'm in, without needing to end the story entirely.</p>
                                
                                <p>I started doing this in moments of emotional crisis. Days when I couldn't hear myself think inside the house. Nights when I was a little too known by the people I loved. I'd say, "I need to go for a quick walk." Sometimes I wouldn't even say it. Just go.</p>
                                
                                <p>And I noticed something. After ten minutes, I was no longer thinking about what had happened. I wasn't even thinking about who I was supposed to be. I was seeing things again. A light bouncing off a window. The precise cruelty of a dead branch on a perfect tree. The teenager yelling into his headphones. The brief permission to feel like nobody in particular.</p>
                                
                                <p>That anonymity made space for something else to emerge: a kind of slow inner honesty that doesn't show up in meetings or journal pages. The truth that waits for silence. The part of me that doesn't interrupt. That just… watches.</p>
                                
                                <p>And it didn't take long for that to become essential.</p>
                                
                                <p>I don't know how to explain this without sounding like I'm romanticizing loneliness. But walkabouts aren't lonely. They're private. They're intimate in a way that's hard to describe—like slipping into bed alone and knowing your body again. Like returning to a part of yourself that doesn't need translation.</p>
                                
                                <p>The best ones don't solve anything. They don't end with a conclusion. There's no big insight, no pivot, no profound decision. Just a kind of cellular reset. Like my mind sighs. Like I can come back inside without dragging all my shadows behind me.</p>
                                
                                <p>We don't talk about that enough, do we? The small, unsponsored rituals that keep people sane. The ones that don't scale. That don't get published or posted or tracked. The sacred habits that don't look impressive but quietly hold your life together.</p>
                                
                                <p>For me, it's walking.</p>
                                
                                <p>It's not a routine. It's a returning.</p>
                                
                                <p>It's the thing that reminds me I exist outside of anyone's expectations, outside of productivity, outside of even who I've told myself I am. A walkabout is not a retreat. It's a re-becoming. And I need it. More than I admit.</p>
                                
                                <p>So if you ever see me stepping out without warning—don't ask where I'm going. I won't know until I get there. And I won't be gone long.</p>
                                
                                <p>But when I come back, I'll be a little more myself again.</p>

                            <h4>The Strength in Seeing</h4>

                                <p>Every so often, you catch it. Someone close to breaking. It's not loud or dramatic. There's no scene. Just a small fracture at the edge of their face, the kind we've all carried at some point. They might be sitting a little too still, or speaking in a tone that feels almost too careful, as if any sudden movement might cause the whole thing to crack open.</p>
                                
                                <p>It's subtle enough that you could miss it entirely if you weren't paying attention. And most people do.</p>
                                
                                <p>In those moments, you face a choice. You can look away, because that's the easier thing to do. The thing we've been trained for. You can give them their space, pretend you didn't notice, tell yourself you'd only make it worse by stepping in. We convince ourselves that's the polite option, that it's what they would want.</p>
                                
                                <p>Or you can do the harder thing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Not the big, dramatic, world-saving thing. Just the quiet, human act of not letting someone carry the full weight of their invisibility. That doesn't have to mean a grand gesture. It might simply mean holding their gaze for a moment longer than you normally would. Or saying something small and soft, in a way no one else can hear. Or offering a resource, a nudge, a reminder that they're not completely alone—even though you may never know whether it helped.</p>
                                
                                <p>Because you don't know what people are carrying. You don't know how close someone might be to breaking. And you may never know what difference it makes when you choose to notice. But it does make a difference.</p>
                                
                                <p>I think about these moments long after they pass. The person on the bench. The colleague whose words sounded a little too measured, as if they might splinter if pushed even slightly. The friend at dinner who pushed food around their plate and smiled at all the right times but never truly joined the conversation. I may not know the full story of what they were carrying, but I do know I was able to offer something small. A word, a resource, a quiet moment of acknowledgment—and I hope it lightened things for them, even just a little.</p>
                                
                                <p>It's not about changing the world. It's not about a lesson. It's about one person noticing another, just long enough for them to feel less alone. That's all.</p>
                                
                                <p>Because strength isn't always about holding your own line. Sometimes it's about holding the line for someone else, even for just a moment, without them ever having to ask.</p>
                                
                                <p>That's not about being a savior. It's about being human.</p>
                                
                                <p>And the truth is, those moments don't just help the other person. They shape us too. They remind us that the people around us are more than passing shapes in a crowd. They remind us that we are all, at different times, the one holding it together by a thread.</p>
                                
                                <p>Maybe that's the quiet purpose of it all. To be the kind of person who notices. To step just slightly outside the cultural script that tells us to stay separate. To take the risk of showing a small act of care, even when it would be easier not to.</p>
                                
                                <p>Because we never know when that one small choice might mean more than we can imagine.</p>

    <h4>The Work of Getting Up</h4>
    <p><em>On being stuck and choosing to move yourself</em></p>
    <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleMotorcycle();" id="motorcycle-toggle">Read more</a></p>
    <div id="full-motorcycle" style="display: none;">
        <p>About one month ago, I fell off my motorcycle. Well, fell off is not the most accurate way to put it. Neither is dropped or crashed. I guess I could say I fell with my motorcycle, ending up underneath it.</p>
        
        <p>I was riding up in Northern Ontario. The air was super crisp and the skies were clear. There's nothing like cruising through the side roads smelling the nearby forests.</p>
        
        <p>Honestly, I wasn't going that fast. The sweet spot for my motorcycle is around 70 to 80 km/h. Any more than that and it gets a little buzzy. It was my first long ride, and I was avoiding the major highways for that reason. I chose to take it slower and to finally let my cruiser-style motorcycle go for a proper cruise.</p>
        
        <p>The total journey was about 3 ½ hours. I was already taking longer. I stopped for some breaks here and there. Mostly to re-orient myself as I made a wrong turn (or three). I also wanted to experience silence. It sounds corny, but the quiet rustle of the trees and the absence of any human noise really felt special. I didn't take off my boots and socks and feel the earth between my toes, but the feelings were along those lines.</p>
        
        <p>I first saw the construction signs going into another set of curvy side road. A re-paving project of some kind. Naturally, not a construction worker in sight. Nor anyone else. It was too deserted of a road. It was during a week-day, early afternoon. Perhaps they were taking a break, or working elsewhere. Either way, the signs said to slow down. The first stretch of construction was a smooth, fresh paved road. I had music in my ears and the sun was coming through the trees making a perfect balance against the cool air. I was overconfident, carving through the turns.</p>
        
        <p>There were more warning signs up ahead, and embarrassingly they barely registered in my mind. Then the road surface changed to gravel. Rough and unpaved, the sudden transition startled me. It wouldn't have if I was paying attention and slowed down.</p>
        
        <p>From what I remember, it felt like I was riding over a million tiny speedbumps. I think my right hand tightened on the front brakes instinctively, but unfortunately it was the wrong instinct. By pulling the front breaks and not slowly stepping on the rear brakes, I unbalanced the bike. I don't remember what happened after that.</p>
        
        <p>Not until I was laying up looking at the sky with my motorcycle laying over my left leg, pinning me. The motorcycle was still running but it soon flooded and stopped. My left arm had carved a gouge in the gravel, and that's the first pain that hit me.</p>
        
        <p>I struggled to get up and realized I was stuck. I took my helmet off and tried pulling my leg again. No movement. While the pain in my arm (and the blood) was uncomfortable, another strange feeling came over me. A weird sense of peace and resignation. I was stuck, and it seemed like there was nothing I could do.</p>
        
        <p>I laid my head back down. It was almost like I was taking a rest break.</p>
        
        <p>The gravel was surprisingly comfortable, or maybe I was just too tired to care. My helmet sat a few feet away, the visor scratched. I could hear the wind moving through the trees. No cars. No people. Just me, pinned under 400 pounds of steel and chrome on an empty construction road in Northern Ontario.</p>
        
        <p>I should have been panicking. That's what you're supposed to do, right? But instead, there was this strange clarity. I thought about how I'd probably miss my planned destination. The thing is, no one would have even been waiting for me. I looked at my arm. The scrape was worse than I thought, bleeding steadily into the gravel. I didn't realize how deep a hole one could make in their elbow. Not terrible, but not great either.</p>
        
        <p>The motorcycle's engine had died, but I could smell the fuel. That snapped something in me. Not quite panic, but enough discomfort to try again. I pushed against the bike with my free leg. Nothing. I tried pulling my trapped leg. Still nothing. The weight wasn't crushing, but it was absolute. I was genuinely stuck.</p>
        
        <p>And that's when the resignation deepened. Not into despair exactly, but into a kind of acceptance. Fine, I thought. This is where I am. This is what's happening.</p>
        
        <p>I lay there for what felt like twenty minutes but was probably five. Watching clouds. Listening to nothing. Part of me was waiting for someone to show up—a construction worker, another rider, anyone. But the other part of me knew I was alone. Really alone. And that this was mine to figure out.</p>
        
        <p>The pain in my arm started to feel less sharp and more insistent. A dull throb that wouldn't let me stay comfortable in my resignation. My leg was starting to go numb under the bike's weight. These weren't emergency-level problems yet, but they were problems that weren't going to solve themselves by lying still.</p>
        
        <p>I took a breath and tried to think practically. The bike was on its left side, pinning my left leg. My right leg was free. Both arms worked, even if one was bleeding. I couldn't lift the bike. Not from this angle, not with this leverage. But maybe I could shift it. Maybe I could wiggle free.</p>
        
        <p>I started small. Pushing the bike with my hands, seeing if I could rock it even an inch. It barely moved, but it moved. I tried again, this time coordinating with my free leg for leverage. Another inch. The pain in my trapped leg sharpened as the pressure shifted, but that meant movement was possible.</p>
        
        <p>It was slow. Pathetically slow. Rock the bike. Rest. Breathe. Push with my leg. Rock again. I was sweating now despite the cool air. My arm was leaving a larger blood stain in the gravel each time I pushed. At some point I started talking to myself—or maybe to the motorcycle. "Come on. Just a little more."</p>
        
        <p>After what felt like forever, I felt my boot shift. Not free, but looser. I gave one more push, harder this time, and pulled my leg at the same angle. It slid out. Without the boot, but I was free.</p>
        
        <p>I lay there for another minute, this time by choice. My left leg hurt but worked. My arm was a mess. I was covered in dust and blood and some motor oil. But I was out.</p>
        
        <p>Getting up was its own challenge. Everything hurt in new ways once I tried to move. But I stood. The motorcycle lay there like it was taking its own rest break. I checked myself over. Nothing broken. Nothing that couldn't heal. Lucky.</p>
        
        <p>It took me another ten minutes to get the bike upright. It started on the fourth try, as I had flooded the engine. But once started, it seemed like nothing had happened. I sat on it for a moment, not quite ready to ride, just processing. The same road stretched ahead. Still gravel, still unpaved, still marked with warning signs I should have paid more attention to.</p>
        
        <p>I thought about turning back. Taking the long way around. But that felt wrong somehow. Not because I needed to prove something, but because I'd already made it this far. The road would turn back to pavement eventually. I just needed to go slowly. Pay attention. Do the thing I should have done in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>So I did. I rode the rest of that gravel stretch at maybe 30 km/h, standing slightly on the pegs to absorb the bumps, focused entirely on the road surface. When I finally hit pavement again, I didn't speed up right away. I just kept going.</p>
        
        <p>The rest of the ride was unremarkable. I stopped once to clean up my arm at a gas station bathroom. I felt embarrassed. It looked worse than it was. The attendant asked if I was okay. I said yes. He didn't seem convinced, but he didn't push. I don't blame him, I'd be cautious asking too much of a scruffy, blood and dirt covered, tired looking stranger too.</p>
        
        <p>By the time I got back to Toronto, the adrenaline had worn off completely. I was just tired. Sore. My left leg was stiff and the bruise looked gnarly. I was ready to be done for the day.</p>
        
        <p>I've thought about that moment a lot since. Lying there under the bike, feeling stuck, choosing resignation over panic. There was something almost peaceful about it, letting go of control I didn't have anyway. But there was also something dangerous about it. That comfort in being stuck. That ease of just staying down.</p>
        
        <p>Getting out required something different. Not heroic effort or dramatic revelation. Just small movements. Persistent, uncomfortable, incremental pushing until something shifted. And then doing it again. And again.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not going to pretend the motorcycle accident is some grand metaphor for life. But I can't deny the feeling was familiar. That moment of lying still, accepting being stuck, waiting for something external to change. And then the slow realization that nothing was coming. That if I wanted to move, I had to move myself.</p>
        
        <p>The scrapes and bruise healed in about a month. The motorcycle needed some minor work, some scratches I didn't bother fixing.</p>
        
        <p>And I'm still riding, though I slow down for construction zones now.</p>
