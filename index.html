                        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                        <p>I've spent most of my career behind the scenes‚Äîhelping innovators, policymakers, and founders connect the dots and build meaningful things. From advising tech-focused public policy, to supporting university research partnerships, to now working with global companies looking to grow in Canada through my role at Toronto Global, my work has always centered on enabling others to succeed.</p>
                        <p>I studied at the University of Toronto and OCAD University, and I've always been drawn to the spaces where creativity, strategy, and community meet. While I don't come from a traditional founder path, I care deeply about the people who build‚Äîand about doing the quiet work that helps make that possible.</p>

                            <p><em>Persona fatigue, and why real relationships is the long game</em></p>
                            <p>When I started working at Canadian Tire‚Äîmy first real job‚ÄîI ended up shadowing this guy named Kevin. He wasn't management, but he ran the floor like it was his. Everyone liked him. He always had a joke ready, remembered customers' names, and could charm a frustrated senior into buying the wrong socket wrench and thanking him for it...</p>
                            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleEssay();" id="essay-toggle">Read more</a></p>
                            <div id="full-essay" class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
                                <p>But here's the thing: Kevin didn't actually know that much about tools. He'd ask me questions about SKUs that I, a 17-year-old barely trained seasonal hire, had to guess my way through. But it didn't matter. Kevin understood people‚Äîand in retail, that's 90% of the job.</p>
                                <p>He couldn't explain how he did it. You just had to watch. I did.</p>
                                <p>From Kevin, I learned how to throw compliments like darts‚Äîfast, effortless, and mostly accurate. How a little physical presence‚Äîlike walking beside someone or handing them the item they were looking for‚Äîcould build micro-trust. How not to challenge people's assumptions, but to lean into their version of the story.</p>
                                <p>He taught me that you didn't need to be good all the time‚Äîjust memorable in the moments that mattered.</p>
                                <p>The result? Kevin could sell snow shovels in July. He was magnetic. And I wanted to be like him.</p>
                                <p>So I learned the tricks. I learned how to manage a room, how to read moods and mirror them, how to switch gears depending on who I was with. And it worked. It worked in retail, it worked in interviews, it even worked at parties.</p>
                                <p>But when it came to actual friendship‚Äîreal, lasting, show-up-when-it's-bad friendship‚Äîit fell apart.</p>
                                <p>The truth is, you can't game long-haul relationships. You can't endlessly adapt and expect depth to grow. If you're constantly tweaking yourself to be more appealing, you're also telling yourself: who I really am isn't enough.</p>
                                <p>And worse, it's exhausting.</p>
                                <p>There are people in your life‚Äîmaybe just one or two‚Äîwho always make you feel like you have to be "on." Where hanging out feels like a low-stakes audition. Where you rehearse your stories a bit more, where your shirt fits a little tighter. And maybe at first, it feels like winning. You're in. You're admired.</p>
                                <p>But you do it 10 times. Then 50. Then 100. And suddenly the whole thing feels like emotional cardio: high effort, low reward.</p>
                                <p>Every time you shift a little to fit someone's frame, you add friction. It's tiny, at first‚Äîjust a sliver of self-betrayal. But friction adds up. One day, you'll choose ease over effort. You'll stop texting back. You'll ghost the group chat. And you'll tell yourself you're just "too busy." But really, you're just tired of shape-shifting.</p>
                                <p>What I've come to believe is that the real killer of meaningful relationships isn't distance or disagreement‚Äîit's the slow, subtle erosion of self over time. Because eventually, we all run out of stamina for pretending.</p>
                                <p>Imagine climbing a mountain with a backpack full of water bottles that aren't yours. That's what curated relationships feel like. You think you're being generous. But you're just making the climb harder, and lonelier.</p>
                                <p>The people worth building with‚Äîthe ones you actually want around in ten years‚Äîwon't need the theatrics. They'll want your messy, quiet, smart-ass, distracted, ridiculous self. Not your "customer-facing" version.</p>
                                <p>I used to think Kevin was winning. But eventually I noticed he spent most of his shift in the stockroom, scrolling his phone, cracking jokes with whoever wandered back. That charisma wasn't free‚Äîit came with a price. And downtime was how he paid for it.</p>
                                <p>He was recovering. From the weight of the role he had to play.</p>
                                <p>I've played that role too. For a long time. I wanted to be impressive, magnetic, indispensable. I wanted people to think, "Damn, I need that guy around." And maybe they did‚Äîfor a while. But it wore me down. Because the second you build a relationship on the performance, you're stuck performing just to keep it.</p>
                                <p>Real connection is quiet. It's who still shows up when there's nothing left to impress.</p>
                                <p>So now? I'm aiming for friendships where I don't have to rehearse. Where I don't need a costume. Where being me is‚Äîsomehow‚Äîstill enough.</p>
                                <p>Because the people I want around aren't my customers. They're the ones I'll hike with, over and over, for the rest of my life. And for that kind of trip, I need to pack light.</p>

                            <h4>What the Canada-U.S. Trade War Means for Toronto's Tech Playbook</h4>
                            <p><em>By Michael Keoshkerian</em></p>
                            <p>Let's get something out of the way: trade wars are no longer abstract. They're not chapter headings in economics textbooks or theoretical debates in Ottawa or D.C. They're real, they're messy, and they're directly impacting how we build companies, pick markets, and hedge global risk. And right now, Canada‚Äîyes, quiet, friendly, under-the-radar Canada‚Äîis in the crosshairs of a full-blown trade rupture with the United States.</p>
                            <p>In a scenario that feels plucked from satire but is deeply real, a returned President Trump has re-imposed sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods. And Canada? It's not backing down. New Prime Minister Mark Carney has retaliated with tariffs of his own, declared the "friendship is over," and begun a major diversification push. The gloves are off. This isn't NAFTA-era soft power. It's elbows-up economic nationalism.</p>
                            <p>In my work at Toronto Global, supporting international companies expanding into the Toronto Region‚Äîparticularly U.S. firms across sectors from tech to advanced manufacturing to life sciences‚Äîthe question is no longer if this will affect us. It's how we respond‚Äîand how we keep delivering certainty in uncertain times...</p>

                                <h4>How We Got Here: The Pendulum Always Swings</h4>
                                <p>Canada's trade history with the U.S. is one of both codependency and caution. We've had periods of deep integration‚Äîfrom the 1965 Auto Pact to the 1989 FTA to NAFTA‚Äîfollowed by waves of protectionism. The 1930s brought the Smoot-Hawley disaster. The 2010s saw Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. And now, in 2025, we're back in the thick of it.</p>
                                <p>If history teaches anything, it's that Canada thrives when it can predict and access the U.S. market‚Äîand adapts quickly when that access is threatened. We saw that after Smoot-Hawley (pivot to Britain), in the 1970s (Pierre Trudeau's "Third Option"), and again after Trump's first term (CETA, CPTPP).</p>
                                <p>But this time? The stakes feel existential.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Trump vs. Carney: It's Personal, and It's Strategic</h4>
                                <p>In the current scenario, Trump has imposed across-the-board tariffs on Canadian goods, citing national security. Carney has responded not just with countermeasures but with a mission: reduce Canadian dependence on the U.S., diversify supply chains, and turn this crisis into a generation-defining economic pivot.</p>
                                <p>For the first time in a century, a Canadian PM is talking openly about never again being "economically beholden" to Washington. He's flying to Europe, accelerating trade with Asia, and pushing domestic reforms to strengthen internal trade and innovation.</p>
                                <p>It's not just a political brawl. It's an inflection point for founders, investors, and economic builders across the country.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Toronto: Hedge, Bridge, Bet</h4>
                                <p>If you're a U.S. company leader watching this unfold, here's why Toronto has always mattered‚Äîand still does:</p>
                                <p><strong>Toronto is a hedge.</strong> You get USMCA access with fewer political headwinds. Canada is adapting quickly by reinforcing its global linkages.</p>
                                <p><strong>Toronto is a bridge.</strong> To Europe (CETA), the UK (interim trade deal), and the Pacific (CPTPP). Your Toronto presence can serve multiple strategic regions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Toronto is a bet.</strong> On resilience, predictability, talent, and the rule of law. When other markets play whack-a-mole with policy, Toronto is where long-term builders go.</p>
                                
                                <h4>The 3 Scenarios We Need to Prep For</h4>
                                <p><strong>Scenario 1: Reconciliation and Renewal</strong><br>Tariffs fade, diplomacy wins, and North American supply chains re-integrate. Toronto continues to boom as the low-cost, high-trust entry point to the U.S.</p>
                                <p><strong>Scenario 2: Decoupling and Diversification</strong><br>Canada succeeds in pivoting east and south. Toronto becomes the anchor for companies looking to access EMEA and APAC while avoiding U.S. volatility.</p>
                                <p><strong>Scenario 3: Muddle Through</strong><br>Tariffs come and go. USMCA holds, barely. Trade disputes flare but stay contained. Smart companies treat Toronto as a vital node in a more complex, risk-adjusted supply chain.</p>
                                
                                <h4>What My Strategy Looks Like at Toronto Global</h4>
                                <p>For anyone reading this and wondering what I'm doing about it‚Äîhere's my strategy, and how I'm helping international companies navigate this moment:</p>
                                <p>Reinforce Toronto's value as the most stable and scalable entry point into the U.S. market‚Äînot in spite of volatility, but because of it.</p>
                                <p>Double down on diversification messaging: CETA, CPTPP, UK deals‚ÄîToronto has long been a platform for global growth, not just North America.</p>
                                <p>Support U.S. executives with sector-savvy, full-stack expansion advisory: From site selection to policy navigation to talent and trade strategy.</p>
                                <p>Position Toronto Global as a long-term partner: We've always adapted through trade shocks. This is no different. Our job is to make your entry resilient.</p>
                                <p>If you're a business leader‚Äîespecially from the U.S.‚Äîreading this: you've always had Toronto in your toolkit. Now you just understand how we're sharpening the edge.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Final Thought</h4>
                                <p>Trade wars are messy. But Toronto's opportunity is clear. In a moment where the U.S. is unpredictable and Europe is hungry for partners, Canada's biggest city has never been more strategically important.</p>
                                <p>If you're building globally, Toronto remains one of the smartest moves you can make. The world just got riskier. We just got more valuable.</p>
