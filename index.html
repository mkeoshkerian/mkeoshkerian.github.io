                        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                        <p>I've spent most of my career behind the scenes‚Äîhelping innovators, policymakers, and founders connect the dots and build meaningful things. From advising tech-focused public policy, to supporting university research partnerships, to now working with global companies looking to grow in Canada through my role at Toronto Global, my work has always centered on enabling others to succeed.</p>
                        <p>I studied at the University of Toronto and OCAD University, and I've always been drawn to the spaces where creativity, strategy, and community meet. While I don't come from a traditional founder path, I care deeply about the people who build‚Äîand about doing the quiet work that helps make that possible.</p>

                    <p>I work with international companies‚Äîespecially from the U.S.‚Äîlooking to establish or expand their presence in Canada. This involves everything from market entry strategy and site selection to navigating regulatory requirements and building local partnerships. Through my role at Toronto Global, I've helped companies across sectors like tech, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing understand the Canadian market, access talent, and leverage incentives. Whether you're a startup looking for your first international office or a scale-up ready to tap into Canada's innovation ecosystem, I provide the strategic guidance to make your expansion successful.</p>

                    <h4>Pancake Networking</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes the best business conversations happen over breakfast. Instead of formal networking events with business cards and elevator pitches, we gather over good food and real conversation. It's where entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders can connect without the usual corporate pretense‚Äîjust genuine discussion about challenges, opportunities, and what we're actually working on. But let's be honest‚ÄîI love pancakes, and this is basically my professional excuse to eat them guilt-free.</p>

Think of it as translating the jargon-heavy world of trade policy, economic strategy, and business development into insights that actually matter for decision-makers.

                                <p>When I started working at Canadian Tire‚Äîmy first real job‚ÄîI ended up shadowing this guy named Kevin. He wasn't management, but he ran the floor like it was his. Everyone liked him. He always had a joke ready, remembered customers' names, and could charm a frustrated senior into buying the wrong socket wrench and thanking him for it.</p>
                                <p>But here's the thing: Kevin didn't actually know that much about tools. He'd ask me questions about SKUs that I, a 17-year-old barely trained seasonal hire, had to guess my way through. But it didn't matter. Kevin understood people‚Äîand in retail, that's 90% of the job.</p>
                                <p>He couldn't explain how he did it. You just had to watch. I did.</p>
                                <p>From Kevin, I learned how to throw compliments like darts‚Äîfast, effortless, and mostly accurate. How a little physical presence‚Äîlike walking beside someone or handing them the item they were looking for‚Äîcould build micro-trust. How not to challenge people's assumptions, but to lean into their version of the story.</p>
                                <p>He taught me that you didn't need to be good all the time‚Äîjust memorable in the moments that mattered.</p>
                                <p>The result? Kevin could sell snow shovels in July. He was magnetic. And I wanted to be like him.</p>
                                <p>So I learned the tricks. I learned how to manage a room, how to read moods and mirror them, how to switch gears depending on who I was with. And it worked. It worked in retail, it worked in interviews, it even worked at parties.</p>
                                <p>But when it came to actual friendship‚Äîreal, lasting, show-up-when-it's-bad friendship‚Äîit fell apart.</p>
                                <p>The truth is, you can't game long-haul relationships. You can't endlessly adapt and expect depth to grow. If you're constantly tweaking yourself to be more appealing, you're also telling yourself: who I really am isn't enough.</p>
                                <p>And worse, it's exhausting.</p>
                                <p>There are people in your life‚Äîmaybe just one or two‚Äîwho always make you feel like you have to be "on." Where hanging out feels like a low-stakes audition. Where you rehearse your stories a bit more, where your shirt fits a little tighter. And maybe at first, it feels like winning. You're in. You're admired.</p>
                                <p>But you do it 10 times. Then 50. Then 100. And suddenly the whole thing feels like emotional cardio: high effort, low reward.</p>
                                <p>Every time you shift a little to fit someone's frame, you add friction. It's tiny, at first‚Äîjust a sliver of self-betrayal. But friction adds up. One day, you'll choose ease over effort. You'll stop texting back. You'll ghost the group chat. And you'll tell yourself you're just "too busy." But really, you're just tired of shape-shifting.</p>
                                <p>What I've come to believe is that the real killer of meaningful relationships isn't distance or disagreement‚Äîit's the slow, subtle erosion of self over time. Because eventually, we all run out of stamina for pretending.</p>
                                <p>Imagine climbing a mountain with a backpack full of water bottles that aren't yours. That's what curated relationships feel like. You think you're being generous. But you're just making the climb harder, and lonelier.</p>
                                <p>The people worth building with‚Äîthe ones you actually want around in ten years‚Äîwon't need the theatrics. They'll want your messy, quiet, smart-ass, distracted, ridiculous self. Not your "customer-facing" version.</p>
                                <p>I used to think Kevin was winning. But eventually I noticed he spent most of his shift in the stockroom, scrolling his phone, cracking jokes with whoever wandered back. That charisma wasn't free‚Äîit came with a price. And downtime was how he paid for it.</p>
                                <p>He was recovering. From the weight of the role he had to play.</p>
                                <p>I've played that role too. For a long time. I wanted to be impressive, magnetic, indispensable. I wanted people to think, "Damn, I need that guy around." And maybe they did‚Äîfor a while. But it wore me down. Because the second you build a relationship on the performance, you're stuck performing just to keep it.</p>
                                <p>Real connection is quiet. It's who still shows up when there's nothing left to impress.</p>
                                <p>So now? I'm aiming for friendships where I don't have to rehearse. Where I don't need a costume. Where being me is‚Äîsomehow‚Äîstill enough.</p>
                                <p>Because the people I want around aren't my customers. They're the ones I'll hike with, over and over, for the rest of my life. And for that kind of trip, I need to pack light.</p>

                                <p>I've always needed a way to quietly leave. Not escape‚Äîjust reset. This piece is about the walkabouts I take when I need to be nobody for a little while. Not a productivity hack. Not a routine. Just a quiet return to myself.</p>
                                <p>There's a certain rhythm I've had to relearn‚Äîone that isn't scheduled, optimized, or announced. It's not something I talk about often, because it doesn't lend itself to a calendar invite or a thread. But it's shaped everything that matters.</p>
                                <p>I call them walkabouts.</p>
                                <p>Not the kind with hiking boots or backpacks or photo evidence. Not exercise. Not even "getting steps in." My walkabouts are quieter than that. More selfish. They are when I leave‚Äînot for long, but long enough. Out the door. Down a street. Sometimes nowhere. Sometimes somewhere very specific. A bench. A railing. A stoop that catches the light.</p>
                                <p>And I just walk.</p>
                                <p>These are not breaks from work. They are breaks from identity. From the version of myself that's required‚Äîon calls, in family rooms, in messages, in roles. There are days when I need to stop holding my life up like it's a tray I'm carrying with careful balance, and instead set it down beside me and look at it without needing to perform inside it.</p>
                                <p>That's what a walkabout gives me: a chance to step outside the story I'm in, without needing to end the story entirely.</p>
                                <p>I started doing this in moments of emotional crisis. Days when I couldn't hear myself think inside the house. Nights when I was a little too known by the people I loved. I'd say, "I need to go for a quick walk." Sometimes I wouldn't even say it. Just go.</p>
                                <p>And I noticed something. After ten minutes, I was no longer thinking about what had happened. I wasn't even thinking about who I was supposed to be. I was seeing things again. A light bouncing off a window. The precise cruelty of a dead branch on a perfect tree. The teenager yelling into his headphones. The brief permission to feel like nobody in particular.</p>
                                <p>That anonymity made space for something else to emerge: a kind of slow inner honesty that doesn't show up in meetings or journal pages. The truth that waits for silence. The part of me that doesn't interrupt. That just‚Ä¶ watches.</p>
                                <p>And it didn't take long for that to become essential.</p>
                                <p>I don't know how to explain this without sounding like I'm romanticizing loneliness. But walkabouts aren't lonely. They're private. They're intimate in a way that's hard to describe‚Äîlike slipping into bed alone and knowing your body again. Like returning to a part of yourself that doesn't need translation.</p>
                                <p>The best ones don't solve anything. They don't end with a conclusion. There's no big insight, no pivot, no profound decision. Just a kind of cellular reset. Like my mind sighs. Like I can come back inside without dragging all my shadows behind me.</p>
                                <p>We don't talk about that enough, do we? The small, unsponsored rituals that keep people sane. The ones that don't scale. That don't get published or posted or tracked. The sacred habits that don't look impressive but quietly hold your life together.</p>
                                <p>For me, it's walking.</p>
                                <p>It's not a routine. It's a returning.</p>
                                <p>It's the thing that reminds me I exist outside of anyone's expectations, outside of productivity, outside of even who I've told myself I am. A walkabout is not a retreat. It's a re-becoming. And I need it. More than I admit.</p>
                                <p>So if you ever see me stepping out without warning‚Äîdon't ask where I'm going. I won't know until I get there. And I won't be gone long.</p>
                                <p>But when I come back, I'll be a little more myself again.</p>

    <h4>The Strength in Seeing</h4>
    <p><em>Small moments of care that shape us</em></p>

    <div id="full-seeing" style="display: none;">
        <p>Every so often, you catch it. Someone close to breaking. It‚Äôs not loud or dramatic. There‚Äôs no scene. Just a small fracture at the edge of their face, the kind we‚Äôve all carried at some point. They might be sitting a little too still, or speaking in a tone that feels almost too careful, as if any sudden movement might cause the whole thing to crack open.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs subtle enough that you could miss it entirely if you weren‚Äôt paying attention. And most people do.</p>
        <p>In those moments, you face a choice. You can look away, because that‚Äôs the easier thing to do. The thing we‚Äôve been trained for. You can give them their space, pretend you didn‚Äôt notice, tell yourself you‚Äôd only make it worse by stepping in. We convince ourselves that‚Äôs the polite option, that it‚Äôs what they would want.</p>
        <p>Or you can do the harder thing.</p>
        <p>Not the big, dramatic, world-saving thing. Just the quiet, human act of not letting someone carry the full weight of their invisibility. That doesn‚Äôt have to mean a grand gesture. It might simply mean holding their gaze for a moment longer than you normally would. Or saying something small and soft, in a way no one else can hear. Or offering a resource, a nudge, a reminder that they‚Äôre not completely alone‚Äîeven though you may never know whether it helped.</p>
        <p>Because you don‚Äôt know what people are carrying. You don‚Äôt know how close someone might be to breaking. And you may never know what difference it makes when you choose to notice. But it does make a difference.</p>
        <p>I think about these moments long after they pass. The person on the bench. The colleague whose words sounded a little too measured, as if they might splinter if pushed even slightly. The friend at dinner who pushed food around their plate and smiled at all the right times but never truly joined the conversation. I may not know the full story of what they were carrying, but I do know I was able to offer something small. A word, a resource, a quiet moment of acknowledgment‚Äîand I hope it lightened things for them, even just a little.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs not about changing the world. It‚Äôs not about a lesson. It‚Äôs about one person noticing another, just long enough for them to feel less alone. That‚Äôs all.</p>
        <p>Because strength isn‚Äôt always about holding your own line. Sometimes it‚Äôs about holding the line for someone else, even for just a moment, without them ever having to ask.</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs not about being a savior. It‚Äôs about being human.</p>
        <p>And the truth is, those moments don‚Äôt just help the other person. They shape us too. They remind us that the people around us are more than passing shapes in a crowd. They remind us that we are all, at different times, the one holding it together by a thread.</p>
        <p>Maybe that‚Äôs the quiet purpose of it all. To be the kind of person who notices. To step just slightly outside the cultural script that tells us to stay separate. To take the risk of showing a small act of care, even when it would be easier not to.</p>
        <p>Because we never know when that one small choice might mean more than we can imagine.</p>

                            <h4>What the Canada-U.S. Trade War Means for Toronto's Tech Playbook</h4>
                            <p><em>By Michael Keoshkerian</em></p>
                            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleTradeEssay();" id="trade-essay-toggle">Read more</a></p>

                                <p>Let's get something out of the way: trade wars are no longer abstract. They're not chapter headings in economics textbooks or theoretical debates in Ottawa or D.C. They're real, they're messy, and they're directly impacting how we build companies, pick markets, and hedge global risk. And right now, Canada‚Äîyes, quiet, friendly, under-the-radar Canada‚Äîis in the crosshairs of a full-blown trade rupture with the United States.</p>
                                <p>In a scenario that feels plucked from satire but is deeply real, a returned President Trump has re-imposed sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods. And Canada? It's not backing down. New Prime Minister Mark Carney has retaliated with tariffs of his own, declared the "friendship is over," and begun a major diversification push. The gloves are off. This isn't NAFTA-era soft power. It's elbows-up economic nationalism.</p>
                                <p>In my work at Toronto Global, supporting international companies expanding into the Toronto Region‚Äîparticularly U.S. firms across sectors from tech to advanced manufacturing to life sciences‚Äîthe question is no longer if this will affect us. It's how we respond‚Äîand how we keep delivering certainty in uncertain times.</p>
